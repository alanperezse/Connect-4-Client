# Connect-4 Client
This Connect 4 client is meant to be used in conjunction with the Connect 4 server made with PHP, also found on my github on its own repository.

### Running project:
The project can be imported and IntelliJ and ran from there (assuming the Dart plugin is present). The file to be run is /bin/connect4.dart

There will be indications of how to play on the console. The PHP server should be instantiated prior to playing the game.

### To play:
Simply run the project. When prompted for information, you may enter an empty string to select the default option (assuming there is one). When prompted for an URL, provide the URL where the server is running. Follow the instructions in the Connect-4-Server for more details on this.
